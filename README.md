# Hey, I'm Kirey 🧠🐧

Welcome to my Arch-ified corner of GitHub.  
I break things, fix them prettier, and build smart CLI tools so others don't have to suffer (unless they want to).

## 🔧 Projects

Here are some tools I'm currently working on:

- 🧠 aur-helper: An interactive and smart terminal UI for installing, removing, and managing packages (yay, paru, pacman)
- 🌐 arch-browsers-installer: A minimalist installer that lets you choose and install browsers easily from a nice terminal interface

## 🧪 Philosophy

- Bash is beautiful  
- Terminal is UI  
- If it runs in Arch, it should look damn good doing it  
- Respect privacy, question permissions, and never trust a script that doesn’t tell you what it’s doing

## 🌐 Community

Want to discuss, get help, or scream because you ran sudo rm -rf / --no-preserve-root by accident?
